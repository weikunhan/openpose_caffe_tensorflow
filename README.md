## Introduction
The course project for 209AS - Special Topics in Circuits and Embedded Systems: 
Security and Privacy for Embedded Systems, Cyber-Physical Systems, and Internet 
of Things.

The project uses Deep Learning (U-Net) to build model remove electronic noise 
and air noise during adversarial example transmission over the air. Our 
contribution is to make the adversarial example attack to be a practical attack.
